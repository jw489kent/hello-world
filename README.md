hello-world
===========
This right here is a program that says hello to the world, so you don't have to. Pretty sweet huh? ~~This readme is actually a big fat phoney though. So you may as well just close it. Or something. I don't care.~~

Actually now it's a real readme. So if you read it now you will be enlightened.

    Check it out. AEnbireb fichjb sribfu y3jrb. Totally genuine CODE!!! #And comments too!

That's pretty much how I will make this thing say

    Hello World!
